## Surely not, you fell for this again! 

Well since you made it. Did you know this is actually know many leading companies go about teaching their employees about phishing. 

Simulated Phishing: is when companies send phishing emails to their own employees! This allows the company to track things like: 

1. How many employees clicked the malicious link
2. How many employees input sensitive data when prompted
3. How many employees actually reported the email

But it doesn't expose any sensitive information to attackers!

It is also possible to identify particular people who click on lots of phishing emails and make sure to give them training. This technique keeps all the employees on their toes as they're always on the lookout.
