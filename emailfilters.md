### Email Spam Filters as a solution to simplistic phising emails

--- 

***Email Spam Filters***:
Email spam filters are programs which try to stop illegitimate emails from reaching users by filtering them. All filtering techniques have a trade off, between rejecting legitimate emails and letting through illegitimate emails. There are many types of filtering techniques avaliable to email administrators. 
   
### Task 1
Go to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques#Automated_techniques_for_email_administrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques#Automated_techniques_for_email_administrators) and pick a technique  under **"2. Automated techniques for email administrators"**. Think of something the technique does well, think of a potential issue you could see with it.

### Task 2
