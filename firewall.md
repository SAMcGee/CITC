### Firewalls as a solution to simplistic phising emails

--- 

***Firewall***:
    A firewall is a a piece of hardware or software which monitors the traffic to and from a network (an interlinked collection of computers). It decides if specific traffic is allowed to get through or not based on a specific set of rules. 

In our scenario we could potentially stop students from revealing information to the hacker by making a rule on the firewall to block outgoing connections to the malicious website!
