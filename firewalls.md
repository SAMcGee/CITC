### Firewalls as a solution to simplistic phising emails

***Firewall***:
    A firewall is a a piece of hardware or software which monitors the traffic to and from a network (an interlinked collection of computers). It decides if specific traffic is allowed to get through or not based on a specific set of rules.       

### Task 1

Consider how a firewall could be used to prevent the hacker from getting sensitive information from school students

###  Extension Activity


Find out the difference between a ***blacklist*** and a ***whitelist*** and discuss which would be more appropiate to stop the attacker.
