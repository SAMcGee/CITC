You've acquired the email addresses of all of the students in a school - ***though you forgot to exclude the computer science students!*** You figured they all must want to see the solutions for the upcoming mathematics exam (which you don't have, but they don't know that!).

>  **From**: free-exam-answers@gmail.com

>  Hey guys,
>
>  Make sure you don't share this around but I found this site, if you put your phone number in you can totally
