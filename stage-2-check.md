### The hacker's gone for now

You discovered that each of these methods can't stop phishing alone. 

1. Firewalls are rule based, and although they could block this attack, all the hacker has to do is copy the website to a different domain and we've have to keep updating our rules! Though this method can certainly help, it costs the hacker money, time, and energy to set it all up again.

2. Email filters are never 100% accurate with detecting spam emails, often they accidentally flag legitimate emails. They can be configured to only flag emails which they are very confident are spam, which can help, though it is never perfect. 

3. Teaching people about phishing is obviously not perfect, we all make mistakes. But by learning about how hackers attack networks and by remembering to take your time and consider all the information you have avaliable, it makes it much less likely for you to fall for a phishing email.

Feel free to either continue to the next stage, or go back and revise some of the topics we discussed.
