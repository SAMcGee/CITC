### You figured out what the code done and stopped it from running!

The code you blocked from running went through every student in the school and tried to log in to their account using a list of passwords which the attacker provided. This sort of attack is called a dictionary attack and can be very damaging because many people reuse passwords, and use rubbish passwords. 

> 123456
> qwerty
> password
> abc123
> password123
> dragon
> football

If you see your password on this list, it's in the top 60 passwords used worldwide. Go change it!

### Beware of urgency!

Although sometimes there are time pressures as we saw here, we had to stop the hacker from running his code. It is still important that we make sure we know what the outcomes of our actions could be. We can't stop every piece of code running on our machines, some may provide important updates or be essential for people's work. We took the time to consider the code we intercepted and reasoned about it before making a decision.
