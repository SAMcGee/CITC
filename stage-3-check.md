### You figured out what the code done and stopped it from running!

The code you blocked from running went through every student in the school and tried to log in to their account using a list of passwords which the attacker provided. This sort of attack is called a dictionary attack and can be very damaging because many people reuse passwords, and use rubbish passwords. 

> 123456
> qwerty
> password
> abc123
> password123
> dragon
> football

If you see your password on this list, it's in the top 60 passwords used worldwide. Go change it!

### Some questions for you to think about

1. In this situation what action did you need to take immediately?
2. What action could you delay, why might you want to delay taking action? 
3. Is there any lesson you could take away from this exercise about how you should deal with time-critical problems in future?
