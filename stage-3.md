## You've figured out how to stop the hacker's even more complicated attack!
### We've got to make sure this doesn't happen again

--- 


***Background***:
    How many cyberattacks do you think start with someone clicking on an phishing email? Click on a button to have a guess

| 31% | 61% | 91% | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| <input onclick="change1()" type="button" value="Guess" id="myButton1"> | <input onclick="change2()" type="button" value="Guess" id="myButton2"> | <input onclick="change3()" type="button" value="Guess" id="myButton3"> |

<script>
function change1()
{
    var elem = document.getElementById("myButton1");
    if (elem.value=="Guess") elem.value = "Nope!";
    else elem.value = "Nope!";
}
function change2()
{
    var elem = document.getElementById("myButton2");
    if (elem.value=="Guess") elem.value = "Nope!";
    else elem.value = "Nope!";
}
function change3()
    var elem = document.getElementById("myButton3");
    if (elem.value=="Guess") elem.value = "That's right! 91%";
    else elem.value = "That's right! 91%";
}
</script>
